##{x} Company's Data Visualization concept

Company wanted to implement a realtime interactive exchange viewer that would allowd you to see floating across the screen exchange events.

I suggested that canvas was a more suitable renderer, but it looks SVG won out in the final design. (Text rendering wasn't going to be a good option for canvas)
