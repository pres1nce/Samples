##PortPort

Internal {x} company contest to use internal data / new real time API

Decided to make a putting like game that would determine if the stock was a good purchase or not 

CyanCat HTML/CSS comes from some GitHub user...I'll source it eventually or remove it

Uses Canvas and html dom events and has some audio included.

take a look at vinnix.com/portport for working version (Chrome is best supported and I think FF works fine too)
